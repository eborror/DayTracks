# About
This project is an app for users to log in and answer daily questions about their day to promote mental health and self-reflection.
In addition, users can log in and write a daily journal. Users can return to their journal any time throughout the day and add or remove to their entry.
Lastly, the app provides ways to look back and reflect on previous journal entries and/or daily questions
### Why?
It's very easy to let days blend without having any memorable moments. This app tries to help keep each day memorable and allows users to look back and see any growth or lifestyle changes.
This app also hopes to provide an outlet to let out any negative emotions built up throughout the day.
# Features and Prompts
Users can access a daily journal, view previous journal entries, answer 10 daily questions, and view previous answers to their daily questions.

Users will be asked these questions and are encouraged to answer each day.

### Running The Project & Troubleshooting
After downloading and unzipping the *daytracks* folder, users can navigate into the file, locate the *daytracks.jar*, and run it using Java SE
If the jar file does not run, then you may need to check your java. Ensure you have JDK 17 or above installed, and JavaFX SDK must be added to the classpath.
If the jar file still does not run, then you may need to recompile the project. The java files are located at *daytracks\src\main\java\daytracks\code*
